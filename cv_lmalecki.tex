Currently, I'm working as a Techniacl Project Manager in a company, which is an official AWS Partner Network member.

The majority of projects I have conducted were built using AWS. This includes projects performed for customers as well as internal products for AdTech \& MarTech company foundations.

I value the fact that, in my current company, we have constant teams. It allows me to work with my team members and with the team itself. I find myself a leader and a very open-minded person who doesn't see any boundaries. I focus on the way how to find a proper way to solve a particular problem.

Depending on the project type I realize, I am working as a product owner, project manager, and scrum master. I'm working with Customers and Stakeholders to scope, design, and deliver software. I'm also keen to optimize morale and happiness in my team using the whole team approach and to promote Agility \& Scrum pillars \& values. I have technical knowledge of the AdTech \& MarTech industry, which requires knowledge of modern AWS solutions. I'm also a big fan of the AWS Well-Architected framework \& pillars.
Besides my IT-related experience, I have over 5 years of professional experience in different industrial sectors (like mining, machine design, customer collaboration). It allowed me to develop my interpersonal and communication skills and general knowledge of physical phenomena.

Why am I looking for a new job and why I'd like to work for you? I find myself a fast learner. I like to be on a vertical learning curve. I believe that my throughout knowledge of AWS Cloud solutions may be a good addition to my Project Management and Team leading experience for you.

In my day to day duties I work with the development team and our customers during all project phases. As a Technical Project Manager I take a strong part in technical discussions and I like to focus most on the Architectural design of the solutions we're building.
After looking into the position requirements - I trully believe I have the required experience and technical passion (especialy regarding big data with conjuntion with AdTech experience) - you're looking for.

If you'd like to know more about me, let's schedule a quick into call using any teleconference tech you're using.

Looking foward to hearing from you,

\section{IT Project Based Experience}
\cventry{Software Engineer\&Technical PM}{Data Lake and CDP}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Objective}: Building a Customer Data Platform with Data Lake.\\
\textbf{Description}: In this project a Data Lake component was developed to combine and transform multiple data sources.
This component was built using AWS Glue data pipelines and AWS Lake Formation. We almost hit the boundaries of AWS.
Customer Data Platform was a system to create segments and audiences basing on user profile information and behaviour. The CDP part was based in large amount on AWS Neptune -- graph database.
}

\cventry{Technical PM}{DMP system}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Description}: Creating an MVP of Data Management Platform. This system included first and third party data collection and syncing. As an output of the infrastructure, the created audiences were sent to the external DSP.
}

\cventry{Technical PM}{GDPR compliance audit tool}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Objective}: Integration of multiple audit components into one system.\\
\textbf{Description}: The goal of this project was to create an system to perform multiple audit operations on a user configured set of databases. The data verification was intended to detect any GDPR-violation related issues.
}

\cventry{Technical PM}{Traffic Curation platform for SSP}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Objective}: Optimise SSP infrastructure cost by picking valuable traffic.\\
\textbf{Description}: To reach the project objective we were implementing heuristic and machine learning algorithms to verify data patterns and optimise infrastructure cost by selecting valuable traffic.
}

\cventry{Software Engineer\&Technical PM}{Leading research of a ML-based DMP segments}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Objective}: Initial research of a DMP system foundations with ML-based segments.\\
\textbf{Description}: Researching a DMP system with ML-based segments (using for example Click-Through Rate algorithms or other event-based prediction systems). Choosing proper technology and libraries for infrastructure.
}

\cventry{Software Engineer\&Technical PM}{Custom JS enabled video adserver}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Objective}: Building an fully functional custom JS enabled video adserver.\\
\textbf{Description}: The adserver met following IAB requirements: VAST, VPAID. Infrastructure consisted of serverless AWS components (Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis).
}

\cventry{Python backend developer}{Attribution DSP}{}{}{}
{\textbf{Description}: Maintenance and development of a DSP infrastructure. The system consisted of over 100 EC2 bidder instances, trackers, and orchestration instances. In scope of this project I was involved in development and specification of: bidder cache management, load balancing, specification of new SSP integrations, upgrading OpenRTB versions and more.
